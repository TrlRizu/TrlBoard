## 10/25/2025 - Research + schematics draft  

Greetings, I am planning to make a custom devboard based on the ESP32-S3-Wroom1 with the size of a raspberry pi pico. I do intend however to have an IMU for future robotics/IOT projects, I think that would be a great addition to this board since the only devboard I am aware of that has that is the arduino nano IOT. 

Since the WROOM1 has WIFI, BLE, Antenna etc built in that would really save a lot of costs and parts that has to fit into the sufficient yet constrained space that we have. I do also know for a fact after researching that ESP32 has its own devkit in that size, so I guess what sets my project apart is the IMU. 

Below is the early draft of parts, after researching (tho not complete yet), I would need. All things still not yet final apart from the esp32 of course. We've got:

- ESP32-S3-WROOM1
- TPS63060 (buck-boost converter)
- BQ24072RGT (Li-Po battery charger)
- B2B-XH-A_LF__SN_ (Li-Po connector)
- USB-C receptacle
- Connector 01x20
- (CP2102N-Axx-xQFN20) USB-UART
- ASM330LHHXTR (IMU)

I found out that the ASM330LHHXTR was way too expensive of an IMU for a hobbyist. And so I looked for alternatives, lo and behold, the MPU-6050:

I struggled with the idea of, how would I classify this, boot-loading? What I mean to say is the question of how I was going to program my board. I found that the ESP32-devkit-C had two buttons: boot and reset. 
What were they?
BOOT: pulls LOW to enter bootloader
RESET: pull LOW to reset chip
ok cool, but I know that I can just program an Arduino board by connecting it to the PC via USB? 
Yes, and that's possible because of a pre-installed bootloader and USB-UART bridge that handles the reset.
So now I needed a USB-UART bridge (I already had one but I didn't know what it was for); I ended up switching to CH340C copying Arduino Nano's -cheap and works perfectly.
And then I noticed some pins on the CH340C [datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/Jiangsu-Qin-Heng-CH340C_C84681.pdf) that puzzled me: DTS & RTS
After reading, I found that they are control signals that would allow me to ditch the buttons. My IDE can toggle them to automatically reset the ESP32 and the bootloader. Also thanks to the ROM-bootloader I wouldn't have to install anything extra.

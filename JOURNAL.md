## 10/25/2025 - Research + schematics draft  

Greetings, I am planning to make a custom devboard based on the ESP32-S3-Wroom1 with the size of a raspberry pi pico. I do intend however to have an IMU for future robotics/IOT projects, I think that would be a great addition to this board since the only devboard I am aware of that has that is the arduino nano IOT. 

Since the WROOM1 has WIFI, BLE, Antenna etc built in that would really save a lot of costs and parts that has to fit into the sufficient yet constrained space that we have. I do also know for a fact after researching that ESP32 has its own devkit in that size, so I guess what sets my project apart is the IMU. 

Below is the early draft of parts, after researching (tho not complete yet), I would need. All things still not yet final apart from the esp32 of course. We've got:

- ESP32-S3-WROOM1
- TPS63060 (buck-boost converter)
- BQ24072RGT (Li-Po battery charger)
- B2B-XH-A_LF__SN_ (Li-Po connector)
- USB-C receptacle
- Connector 01x20
- (CP2102N-Axx-xQFN20) USB-UART
- ASM330LHHXTR (IMU)

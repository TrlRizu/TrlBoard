## 10/25/2025 - Research + schematics draft  

Greetings, I am planning to make a custom devboard based on the ESP32-S3-Wroom1 with the size of a raspberry pi pico. I do intend however to have an IMU for future robotics/IOT projects, I think that would be a great addition to this board since the only devboard I am aware of that has that is the arduino nano IOT. 

Since the WROOM1 has WIFI, BLE, Antenna etc built in that would really save a lot of costs and parts that has to fit into the sufficient yet constrained space that we have. I do also know for a fact after researching that ESP32 has its own devkit in that size, so I guess what sets my project apart is the IMU. 

Below is the early draft of parts, after researching (tho not complete yet), I would need. All things still not yet final apart from the esp32 of course. We've got:

- ESP32-S3-WROOM1
- TPS63060 (buck-boost converter)
- BQ24072RGT (Li-Po battery charger)
- B2B-XH-A_LF__SN_ (Li-Po connector)
- USB-C receptacle
- Connector 01x20
- (CP2102N-Axx-xQFN20) USB-UART
- ASM330LHHXTR (IMU)

## 10/27/2025 - Drafting Schematic pt2  


I found out that the ASM330LHHXTR was way too expensive of an IMU for a hobbyist. And so I looked for alternatives, lo and behold, the MPU-6050:

I struggled with the idea of, how would I classify this, boot-loading? What I mean to say is the question of how I was going to program my board. I found that the ESP32-devkit-C had two buttons: boot and reset. 
What were they?
BOOT: pulls LOW to enter bootloader
RESET: pull LOW to reset chip
ok cool, but I know that I can just program an Arduino board by connecting it to the PC via USB? 
Yes, and that's possible because of a pre-installed bootloader and USB-UART bridge that handles the reset.
So now I needed a USB-UART bridge (I already had one but I didn't know what it was for); I ended up switching to CH340C copying Arduino Nano's -cheap and works perfectly.
And then I noticed some pins on the CH340C [datasheet](https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/Jiangsu-Qin-Heng-CH340C_C84681.pdf) that puzzled me: DTS & RTS
After reading, I found that they are control signals that would allow me to ditch the buttons. My IDE can toggle them to automatically reset the ESP32 and the bootloader. Also thanks to the ROM-bootloader I wouldn't have to install anything extra.

## 10/30/2025 - Routing PCB draft  

The plan of making it in somewhat the size of a Raspberry Pi Pico is still on full steam. This is the first draft. Not every passive is there, but I think I've spent long enough for today drafting this:

Also, you may have noticed that the DHT11 sensor is not on the board. That is intentional as I am in a dilemma: to include or not to. It arose from its placement requirements, it can't be near ICs as they may tamper with the accuracy of the sensor. Plus the IMU as well have to be placed more meticulously and I still hadn't figured out where I would be positioning it. Below is the attached photo of the DHT which I had tried including a while ago:

## 11/1/2025 - Routing again  

I've got to plan my layout once again. I opted to place the battery charger and the buck-boost converter on opposite sides almost mirrored on the USB and USB-UART bridge line:

But I do really need to make this neater, it doesn't look so appealing to me...

Future additions:
- NTC thermistor
- SMD temp sensors

there was a suggestion to me to tackle the sensitivity:
"place a connector and have a long NTC probe"
